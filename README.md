## Project Info

Space Rover is a mobile-first, educational website about space. As a user of Space Rover, you’ll be able to select a planet or other celestial body and a date, and see how far it is from earth or another celestial body at that specific moment in time. We'll also tell you how long it would take you to get there. Don’t want to see the distance in miles? That’s ok! You can also view the distance in kilometers or other units of measures (some of them cuter than others). Along with distance and travel time, the user will get to see an assortment of facts about the planet they’ve selected.
