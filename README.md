# space_rover

Space Rover is a mobile-first, educational website about space. As a user of Space Rover, you’ll be able to select a planet or other celestial body and a date, and see how far the earth is from that planet at that specific moment in time as well as how long it would take you to get there. Don’t want to see the distance in miles? That’s ok! You can also view the distance in kilometers or other units of measures (some of them cuter than others). Along with distance and travel time, the user will get to see an assortment of images and facts about the planet they’ve selected.

Possible Improvements & Stretch Goals:
1. Add a graphical representation of the distance from the earth to the selected planet
2. Let users provide a location in their search in order to get more specific results
3. Tied to the previous goal… add a feature to tell the user when they will next be able to see the selected planet with the naked eye from their selected location
4. Add an image carousel to the results page that dynamically displays the images of the selected planet
5.  Add option to change start location from earth to another celestial body
